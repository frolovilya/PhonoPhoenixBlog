KRK monitors are a popular choise for DJ setups, especially for bass-heavy music lovers. They are relatively cheap and sound decent. At the same time, when you look on Kleinanzeigen or eBay, there're many used KRKs on sale with various problems. I decided to buy a pair and check myself what it's like inside and if they're easy to fix. In my case there were no sound coming out of on of the monitors at all.

Here's how the monitor look from inside. Split power supply, pre-amp for the incoming signal and two amplifiers for low and high frequency speakers. Cheap components and fairly inaccurate PCB montage. PreSonus Eris is way ahead in the same price range in terms of quality and components used.

In the RP5 G2 version there're two TDA2052 amps driving the high frequency tweeter and low frequency speaker both connected to a huge heat sink. The amps are powered separately so that there're two rectifiers sections and four capacitors, two for each speaker. Speaker wires are soldered right into the board and fixed with a black substance, which is present all over the PCB.

KRKs were completely silent when powering on, even no usual "pop" sound was heard. After checking all voltages and wires connectivity I decided to investigate the Mute functionality of the TDA2052.

Here's the outline from the datasheet:


> The pin 3 (MUTE/STAND-BY) controls the amplifier status by three different thresholds, referred to -VS. 
>
> When its voltage is lower than the first threshold (1V, with a +70mV hysteresis), the amplifier is in STAND-BY and all the final stage current generators are off. Only the input MUTE stage is on in order to prevent pop-on problems. 
>
> At Vpin3=1.8V the final stage current generators are switched on and the amplifier operates in MUTE. 
>
> For Vpin3 =2.7V the amplifier is definitely on (PLAY condition).

So you need to measure pin 3 voltage in reference to the pin 4 (-Vdd) instead of the ground. In my case it was less than 1V, which means that TDA2052 was on stand-by mode.

MUTE signal is generated by the UP3 op-amp on the pre-amp board and then feed into the power board.

Here's the schematics reproduction in LTSpice:

V15 voltage is the +15V supply voltage coming to this pre-amp PCB. MUTE is an out/in port that is then connected to the pin 3 of the TDA2052. So basically when the voltage on the non-inverting input of the pre-amp is bigger than on the inverting, PIN3 in reference to VDDn voltage becomes more than required 2.7 threshold. If V15 supplies 15V, but mentioned above isn't the case, then you have a problem somewhere in between. 

In my case I traced it down to the C17 capacitor. After replacing it with the new one, the MUTE problem was fixed. But both monitors were producing audible hiss and cracking noise. In [the second part](/blog/noisy-krks-part-2) of this story we'll find the solution to the noise problem.
