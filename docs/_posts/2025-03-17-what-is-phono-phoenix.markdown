Offering high-quality 3D-printed spare parts, upgrades and accessories for DJ and Hi-Fi electronic devices. 
Using professional 3D printing equipment and the best engineering filaments.

I've been DJing, collecting vinyl, and owning a pair of Technics SL 1210 MK2 turntables since 2010, all while being an electronics enthusiast. In my personal restoration projects, I document and share the process of working on audio electronics repair through this blog, providing useful details along the way. 

<b>Please note, that repair services are not offered at this moment.</b>
