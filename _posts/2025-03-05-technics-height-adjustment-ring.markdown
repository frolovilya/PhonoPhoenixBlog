With the properly working height adjustment ring you could perfectly align your tonearm in parallel with a record.

Probably the most common problem I've encountered with nearly every SL1200/1210 turntable is that the ring was stuck. The cause is quite simpleâ€”old grease becomes stiff over time, and the fine threading on the height adjustment ring no longer screws properly. Here's my video attempt to capture the full process of maintaining the tonearm.
