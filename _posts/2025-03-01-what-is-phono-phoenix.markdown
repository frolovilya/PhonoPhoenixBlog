I've been DJing, collecting vinyl, and owning a pair of Technics SL 1210 MK2 turntables since 2010, all while being an electronics enthusiast. In my personal restoration projects, I document and share the process of working on audio electronics repair through this blog, providing useful details along the way. 

Repair services are not offered at this moment. Licensing is in progress.
