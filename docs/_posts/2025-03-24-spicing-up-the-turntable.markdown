I found this topic both broad and fascinating when I was restoring my first pair of Technics. Many of these devices are now around 30 years old and have never been serviced in their lifetime. They are often full of dust, dirt, and sometimes even remnants of alcohol and party glitter. The height adjustment rings can get stuck, and the pitch faders can become rusted and scratchy. All of these issues require proper cleaning, re-greasing, and re-oiling. And of course, selecting the right materials is always a challenge.

While you can still find original grease or oil on eBay, I think it makes little sense to buy an overpriced tube of "original" grease for ten times the price of a good modern alternative. The market today offers better options that will last longer and provide the same original touch and feel for the moving parts.

Short disclaimer: I’m not affiliated with any of the companies whose products are mentioned here; I’m simply sharing my personal experience and the best tools I’ve found for my own use.

# De-dusting
 __Kontakt 67__ is a compressed air spray for electronics which is perfect for tonearm detailing, especially in areas that are hard to reach with a cotton swab. It also removes dust from a PCB in seconds. However, I find the 30€ price tag quite steep for a 200ml bottle, even though it performs better than the more affordable Kontakt PB alternative.

# De-greasing
There are plenty of options on the market, but the classic __WD-40__ works just as well. It's easy to find everywhere and evaporates quickly. Many people think of WD-40 as a lubricant, but it's actually a solvent that helps remove old grease and loosen rusted parts. Always apply the proper grease after cleaning with WD-40.

# Grease
__Super Lube Multi-Purpose Synthetic Grease__ is an essential "spice" for electronics maintenance. I use it on any non-conductive moving parts. It's a better option than lithium or graphite lubricants if you don’t need to work in extreme load or temperature conditions. However, it’s quite thick, so for more delicate appliances, you might want to consider something else.

# Oil
"Apply 2 or 3 drops of oil after every 2000 hours of operation," according to the Technics Service Manual. The original SFWO 010 Technics oil is actually Anderol 465, a synthetic ISO 68 lubrication oil with SAE 30 viscosity. The only alternative I’ve found is __3-in-one Motor Oil__. Note that this is the special blue-bottle version designed for electric motors, not the regular 3-in-one multipurpose oil.

# Fader Lubrication
DeoxIT F series offers a range of products specifically designed for conductive faders, and they work well for pitch fader renewal. However, it’s not always obvious which product to use unless you experiment with them. If you spray __DeoxIT F5__ into the pitch fader, it will wash out any old grease (if present) and make the fader practically unusable. It should be paired with __DeoxIT DFG-213__ fader grease, a thicker grease designed to smooth fader operation. So, if you're confident enough to desolder the pitch fader, clean it with F5, and then lubricate it with DFG-213, you’ll achieve the best results. Otherwise, a few drops of __DeoxIT F100L__ lubricant might help without disassembling the fader.

# After Soldering
__Kontakt LR__ is my favorite technical spray. It magically gives a professional look to a PCB, making it appear as though it was factory-soldered. It removes flux and makes the PCB shine. I always add a touch of Kontakt LR after soldering. The smell, however, is horrible.

# Voltage Regulator Montage
Technics turntables have a voltage regulator connected to a heat sink with white, smelly thermal paste. After repainting the turntable or if the paste has dried out over time, it’s a good idea to apply a fresh layer. __Arctic MX-4__ is a very popular option. While I can’t claim to be an expert in thermal pastes, this one is easy to apply, has no unpleasant smell, and, importantly, it doesn't conduct electricity.
